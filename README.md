# Codes
A little repo to store the scripts/code I write. Mainly aiming Python.

### 1. Vigenere Cipher

Wrote it for an assignment on Cryptography. Finds pattern of length 3 which might be encrypted by the same-relative key letters.

Can be improved: Consider ciphertext length of any size (and not just the multiple of key length), add more attacks

### 2. Nomenclator Cipher

Each letter can be substituted by another letter or a symbol. Also able to replace words or sequence of letter with something else.

Only implemented the encryption.

Can be improved: Add decryption
