do you remember the shire mr frodo it ll be spring soon and the orchards will be in blossom and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket and they ll be sowing the summer barley in the lower fields and eating the first of the strawberries with cream do you remember the taste of strawberries
no sam I cant recall the taste of food nor the sound of water nor the touch of grass Im naked in the dark with nothing no veil between me and the wheel of fire I can see him with my waking eyes
then let us be rid of it once and for all come on, mr frodo I cant carry it for you but I can carry you
